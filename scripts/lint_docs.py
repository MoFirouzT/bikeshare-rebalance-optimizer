"""Documentation linter: the enforceable subset of the writing charter.

The charter lives in ``docs/conventions.md``; this script gates the rules that can be
checked mechanically. Everything else there is review judgment.

Docs rot silently because a sentence about the code is not executable, so nothing
fails when the code moves underneath it. These checks make the checkable subset fail
loudly instead:

  - no line contains an em dash                                       [if adopted]
  - every file stays under the line cap, exemptions aside
  - no forbidden (career / positioning) word anywhere
  - no bare release name (``R2``) in a committed file; phase IDs (``R2.1``) are fine
  - no coined ``-able`` / ``-ability`` word that is not a real adjective
  - canonical docs carry an ``*Assumes:*`` line naming what they take as given
  - cross-doc ``file.md#anchor`` links resolve to a real heading
  - a spec's ``Depends on:`` IDs name real specs, and the graph is acyclic
  - a spec marked ``Implemented`` records an outcome for every box, and carries the
    ``Decisions`` section that the indexes send readers to
  - specs carry no instruction that was already carried out
  - no document narrates its own edit history outside the places that record it
  - a spec's ``pkg.x.y`` references name real modules or attributes   [if configured]
  - a ``<canonical>.md §<ID>`` reference anywhere in the repo names a section that
    file actually has                                                 [if configured]
  - math renders on GitHub: no LaTeX spacing control symbols, no ``$ x$``

A line may suppress the per-line checks (em dashes, forbidden words, math) with a
trailing ``<!-- lint-ok -->`` HTML comment, invisible when rendered. Use it sparingly;
it does not affect the length or ``*Assumes:*`` checks.

Run:  python3 scripts/lint_docs.py
Exits non-zero on any violation, printing ``path:line: message``.
